            <i>Every artist has a color palette that is the foundation of his or her inspiration. 
                From Monet’s calming blues to Matisse’s intense red, the balance of colors, contrast, texture,
                 and style is what draws the viewer in and creates an emotional response in the viewer.
                 As a Fine Art photographer, 
                I’ve found myself returning again and again to the golden Fine Art yellow that can be
                 found in the works of Post-Impressionist artists such as Vincent van Gogh. 
                 Perhaps, this is why Hoi An, Vietnam with its golden rice fields, yellow buildings,
                  and immense blue skies immediately felt like home to me. 
                It was like walking into a master painting from the 1800s.
                Read on to learn more about a few of my favorite artists who’ve influenced my
                 use of the color yellow of some of my Fine Art photographs.</i>
