            <i>Heavy traffic on a cloudy day as folks make the late afternoon commute back home.
                 One thing I truly love about this city is the fact that just by driving across town, a person may pass under,
                  over, and around half-a-dozen reminders that they are in a city built around a castle.
                   Americans have no concept of this kind of ancient history. For American culture is a young culture, 
                and its artifacts are those of the peoples killed by Europeans to make room for Manifest Destiny..</i>
