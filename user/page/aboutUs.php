                    <p>Ben’s Biography Ben Quick spent several years exploring the deserts and mountain ranges in the Western US before settling down, becoming a proud father, and earning a BS in natural resource management and an MS in American Studies
                        from Utah State University in Logan, Utah. After completing his Master's degree Ben and his son moved to Tuscon, Arizona where Ben earned his MFA in nonfiction writing at the University of Arizona while serving as the Beverly Rogers
                        Nonfiction Fellow. During graduate school, Ben discovered a passion for teaching. Since then, he’s spent nearly 20 years teaching academic and creative writing to university students in the US and Vietnam. <br><br>After eight years
                        of working with undergraduate students at the University of Arizona, Ben moved to Da Nang, Vietnam--in part to work, and in part to gather firsthand knowledge of the terrible war in which his father fought so many years ago. What
                        he found was a home. In addition to his work as a photographer and author, Ben holds a full-time position as Professor of English and Communication Studies at the American University in Vietnam.<br><br> Ben’s writing has appeared
                        in journals and magazines around the world and won several prestigious awards. His photographs have been featured in some of the world’s most respected publications--sometimes alongside his writing and other times as stand-alone
                        art. This project offers him the chance to engage both his creative passions on one platform. If you are reading this, know that he is honored to have you pay a visit to the website. He hopes your stay will be fruitful.</p>
